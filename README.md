Build and Learning:
    This project was a fun opportunity to practice using modules and not using the global scope to hold variables. The learning curve on this project was a lot steeper as I had to make sure to tuck away variables correctly and had to analyze what functions would need access to what variables and what to return if needed. Although, I feel like I understood scope well; I didn't until completing this project. A lot of the bugs that I ended up needing to fix where because I had variables tucked away in a function and I had to bring them out to the local scope within a module. Overall, I had a blast learning and building this project and am eager to come back to it to add an AI mode VS a Computer.
